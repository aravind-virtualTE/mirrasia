As Hong Kong does not have a separate capital account like other countries, you can deposit the share capital amount after opening a corporate account. If the opening of a corporate account is delayed or there is no corporate account, the director(or a person in charge of your company's cash) can keep the capital amount and use it for the company's expenditures (as a petty cash account), and submit supporting documents of the expenditures such as expense receipts and etc. However, this is the capital payment method based on Hong Kong, and procedures and reporting obligations under the Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Exchange Transaction Act in other countries must be separately checked and processed.

For example, if you trade both purchases and sales in USD, setting the share capital in USD is convenient for accounting. If this is not the case, all currencies of translations must be converted to the base currency for accounting.

If you plan to transfer shares in the future, it is recommended that the number of shares is efficient enough in order to divide the shares according to the desired ratio. For example, issuing 10 shares at the time of incorporation, but if you want to transfer 33.33% of the total shares to another partner, the process will become complicated as it required to issue additional shares to match the proportion you wish to divide. In addition, if you wish to have a difference (eg HKD5) on the par value per share to the future investor after issuing the par value per share as HKD1 at the time of incorporation, it is recommended to consider this before you decide to issue the shares."
